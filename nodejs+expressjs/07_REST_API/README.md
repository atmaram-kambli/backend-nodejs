## REST API - REpresentetional Stare Transfer API

```
    REST is the type of the API that follows the principle of REST architecture. REST is the architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. to perform operations on resources identified be URL's
```

- REST APIs typically use formats like JSON or XML for data exchange.

- REST APIs are statless, meaning each request from client to the server contains all the information necessary to process the request. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to maintain.

- In REST API, client requests for resources and then the server responds to the client with the representation of current state of that resource and all relevent information about it in a standardized format such as JSON or XML.



#### Real life example scenario

- API : Think of an API as the "menu" in the restaurant. The menu list all the options, along with how to ask for them and what will you get back.

- REST API : A REST API is like a waiter who follows specific rules to take the order and serve the food.



REST API are just one of the type of API which makes communication between applications more scalabe and efficient
